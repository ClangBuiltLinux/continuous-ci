Subject: [PATCH 19/32] kbuild: clang: remove crufty HOSTCFLAGS

commit df16aaac26e92e97ab7234d3f93c953466adc4b5 upstream.

When compiling with `make CC=clang HOSTCC=clang`, I was seeing warnings
that clang did not recognize -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks for HOSTCC
targets.  These were added in commit 61163efae020 ("kbuild: LLVMLinux:
Add Kbuild support for building kernel with Clang").

Clang does not support -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks, so adding it to
HOSTCFLAGS if HOSTCC is clang does not make sense.

It's not clear why the other warnings were disabled, and just for
HOSTCFLAGS, but I can remove them, add -Werror to HOSTCFLAGS and compile
with clang just fine.
