Subject: [PATCH 22/25] efi/libstub/arm64: Set -fpie when building the EFI stub

commit 91ee5b21ee026c49e4e7483de69b55b8b47042be upstream.

Clang may emit absolute symbol references when building in non-PIC mode,
even when using the default 'small' code model, which is already mostly
position independent to begin with, due to its use of adrp/add pairs
that have a relative range of +/- 4 GB. The remedy is to pass the -fpie
flag, which can be done safely now that the code has been updated to avoid
GOT indirections (which may be emitted due to the compiler assuming that
the PIC/PIE code may end up in a shared library that is subject to ELF
symbol preemption)

Passing -fpie when building code that needs to execute at an a priori
unknown offset is arguably an improvement in any case, and given that
the recent visibility changes allow the PIC build to pass with GCC as
well, let's add -fpie for all arm64 builds rather than only for Clang.
